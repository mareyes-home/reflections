When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can have more control and not have unusable commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are only in GitHub, similar to clones. Clones can be locally or from GitHub
to local. Branches are for experimenting with your code.
