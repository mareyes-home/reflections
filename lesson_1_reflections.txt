How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because it can shows the lines in which the files are different.
    + if a line is added
    - if a line is deleted

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you can find bugs easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Because when you commit manually you have more flexibility. If the versions are automatically saved
    we can have problems because maybe we can have code that is not going to compile.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because sometimes is necessary to keep changes tracked of multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log you can see how many commits have been made, and with git diff
    you can see the difference within 2 files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you keep track of everything you have changed

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Keep track of my projects
